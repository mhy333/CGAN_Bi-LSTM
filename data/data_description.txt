8. WOB                           - Weight on Bit, force applied on drill bit (kN or appropriate unit)
9. RPM                           - Rotations per minute of drill string (rpm)
10. TOR                          - Torque applied on drill string (Nm or appropriate unit)
11. PumpPressure                 - Pump pressure during drilling (MPa or appropriate unit)
12. Displacement                 - Drilling fluid displacement rate (L/s or appropriate unit)
13. Density                      - Drilling fluid density (g/cm³ or kg/m³)
14. ECD                          - Equivalent Circulating Density (g/cm³ or kg/m³)
15. HookLoad                     - Load measured at the hook (kN or appropriate unit)
16. ROP                          - Rate of Penetration, drilling speed (m/h or ft/h)
17. DrillTime                    - Time duration of drilling (hours or minutes)
18. DC                           - Drill string circulation status (categorical or numeric)
19. LagTime                      - Time lag in system response (seconds or minutes)
20. OutletFlow                   - Flow rate of drilling fluid at outlet (L/s or m³/h)
21. FormationPressureGradient    - Pressure gradient of formation fluid (MPa/m or psi/ft)
22. FormationRupturePressureGradient - Pressure gradient causing formation rupture (MPa/m or psi/ft)
23. TheoreticalMaximumDisplacement - Maximum theoretical fluid displacement (L/s or other)
24. DisPumpRatio                 - Ratio of displacement to pump capacity (dimensionless)
25. LostCirculation              - Label indicating lost circulation occurrence (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
26. MLR                          - Multidimensional Lost Circulation Risk Index (numeric)
  
Notes:

- The full dataset includes many more samples and features than this subset.
- Missing values have been handled or excluded in this example dataset.
- The MLR index is derived from domain knowledge and serves as a key feature in model training.

Usage:

- This dataset is used for data augmentation and model training/testing in the project.
