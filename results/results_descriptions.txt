Figures Description:
---------------------
1. roc_curve_cgan_bilstm.png  
   - ROC curve of the CGAN_Bi-LSTM model  
   - Shows the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate  
   - AUC > 0.98

2. pr_curve_cgan_bilstm.png  
   - Precision-Recall curve for CGAN_Bi-LSTM model  
   - Indicates performance under imbalanced data conditions  

3. training_loss_curve_cgan.png  
   - Training loss trend of CGAN (generator and discriminator) over epochs  
   - Demonstrates convergence behavior  

4. confusion_matrix_comparison.png  
   - Comparison of confusion matrices from different models  
   - Helps visualize the distribution of true/false positives and negatives  

5. model_comparison_bar.png  
   - Bar chart showing performance (accuracy, F1, AUC) of each model  
   - Includes LSTM/Bi-LSTM under raw, SMOTE, and CGAN conditions  

6. knowledge_embedding_effects.png  
   - Effects of different knowledge embedding strategies (MLR-in, MLR-at, etc.)  
   - Highlights improvements in accuracy and generalization

Tables Description:
---------------------
1. performance_metrics_all_models.csv  
   - Contains accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC of all 9 baseline models  
   - Each row corresponds to one model (e.g., bi-lstm_raw, lstm_smote, etc.)

2. knowledge_embedding_comparison.csv  
   - Detailed results of the 4 knowledge-enhanced models  
   - Comparison across multiple metrics and datasets  

Usage:
-------
These results were used to support key findings in the manuscript, including:
- Model selection (CGAN_Bi-LSTM outperforms others)
- Justification for knowledge embedding strategies
- Visualization of training dynamics

Note:
-------
Not all results are directly included in the paper due to space limitations. 
This folder provides the full set of experimental evidence for transparency and reproducibility.
