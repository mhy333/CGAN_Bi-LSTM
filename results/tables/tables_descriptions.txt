This folder contains tabular results that support the experimental findings in the manuscript:

These tables include:

- Model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC) across different data augmentation methods (Original, SMOTE, CGAN) and model architectures (LSTM, Bi-LSTM).
- Loss records during CGAN training.
- Results of knowledge embedding ablation studies, evaluating the effect of MLR-based strategies.
- Detailed classification reports and confusion matrix values.

All files are in CSV format and organized to support transparent and reproducible evaluation of the proposed approach.
